Heart Disease Prediction – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Heart Disease Prediction  
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning  
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

The Heart Disease Prediction project is a supervised machine learning classification task. The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical and clinical parameters.

This project focuses on healthcare data analysis, data preprocessing, and building a reliable predictive model to assist in early detection of heart-related conditions.

2. Problem Statement

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help doctors and patients take preventive measures. Manual diagnosis based on multiple parameters can be complex and error-prone.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify patients as:

* 1 → Heart Disease Present
* 0 → No Heart Disease

based on medical attributes.

3. Dataset Description

* The dataset contains medical records of patients.
* Each row represents one patient.
* The dataset includes numerical and categorical health-related features.

 Dataset Columns (Table Headers):

* age – Age of the patient
* sex – Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
* cp – Chest pain type
* trestbps – Resting blood pressure
* chol – Serum cholesterol level
* fbs – Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl)
* restecg – Resting electrocardiographic results
* thalach – Maximum heart rate achieved
* exang – Exercise-induced angina
* oldpeak – ST depression induced by exercise

 Target Variable:

* 0 → No Heart Disease
* 1 → Heart Disease

4. Tools and Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:

  * NumPy – Numerical computations
  * Pandas – Data handling and analysis
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
  * Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

---

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed data analysis and visualization to understand patterns in the dataset:

* Checked correlation between features and heart disease
* Analyzed age, cholesterol, and heart rate distributions
* Visualized relationships using bar plots and heatmaps

EDA helped identify important features influencing heart disease prediction.

6. Methodology

 6.1 Data Loading

* Loaded the dataset using Pandas
* Checked for missing values and data consistency

 6.2 Data Preprocessing

* Encoded categorical variables into numerical format
* Handled missing or invalid values
* Separated features and target variable
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets

 6.3 Model Selection

* Logistic Regression was chosen because:

  * It performs well for binary classification problems
  * It is interpretable and efficient
  * It is widely used in medical prediction systems

 6.4 Model Training

* Trained the Logistic Regression model on training data
* The model learned relationships between medical parameters and heart disease

 6.5 Model Testing

* Evaluated the model using unseen test data
* Generated predictions for performance analysis

---

7. Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

These metrics ensured balanced and reliable predictions.

---

8. Results and Observations

* The model accurately classified patients with and without heart disease
* Age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate were significant indicators
* Logistic Regression provided stable and interpretable results

---

9. Conclusion

The Heart Disease Prediction project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can assist in healthcare decision-making. The model helps predict the likelihood of heart disease using patient data, emphasizing the importance of early detection and data-driven diagnosis.

10. Future Enhancements

* Use advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Deploy the model as a web-based healthcare application
* Integrate real-time patient data input
