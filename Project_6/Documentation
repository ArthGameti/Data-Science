Wine Quality Checker – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Wine Quality Checker  
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning  
Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

The Wine Quality Checker project is a supervised machine learning classification task. The objective of this project is to predict whether a wine is of Good or Bad quality based on its physicochemical properties.

Wine quality is classified using the following rule:

* Good (1): Quality ≥ 7
* Bad (0): Quality < 7

This project also includes data analytics, visualization, and a predictive system for checking wine quality for a single input instance.

2. Problem Statement

Evaluating wine quality manually requires expert knowledge and is subjective. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can objectively predict wine quality using measurable chemical attributes.

The system helps:

* Winemakers maintain consistent quality
* Businesses automate quality checks
* Analysts gain insights from wine data

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before model training, data analytics and visualization were performed to understand the dataset:

* Checked data distribution and balance
* Visualized feature correlations using heatmaps
* Analyzed the impact of alcohol, sulphates, and acidity on wine quality
* Identified important features influencing quality

EDA helped in understanding patterns and improving model reliability.

6. Methodology

 6.1 Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
* Initial inspection is performed to check shape, null values, and data types.

 6.2 Data Preprocessing

* Converted wine quality into binary labels (0 and 1).
* Separated independent features and target variable.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

 6.3 Model Selection

* Random Forest Classifier is chosen because:

  * It handles non-linear relationships effectively
  * It reduces overfitting using ensemble learning
  * It performs well on tabular data
  * It provides feature importance information

 6.4 Model Training

* The Random Forest model is trained on the training dataset.
* The model learns complex relationships between wine attributes and quality.

 6.5 Model Testing

* The trained model is evaluated using unseen test data.
* Predictions are generated for performance evaluation.

7. Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report

 Performance Results:

* Training Accuracy: 100%
* Testing Accuracy: 94%

High testing accuracy indicates strong generalization and minimal overfitting.

8. Predictive System

A small predictive system was developed to:

* Accept input values for a single wine sample
* Predict whether the wine quality is Good or Bad

This system demonstrates real-world usability of the trained model.

9. Results and Observations

* Random Forest achieved excellent accuracy on both training and testing data.
* Alcohol and sulphates were strong indicators of wine quality.
* Data visualization helped identify important trends and features.
