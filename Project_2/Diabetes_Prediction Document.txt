Diabetes Prediction – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Diabetes Prediction  
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning  
Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The Diabetes Prediction project is a supervised machine learning classification task. The main objective of this project is to predict whether a patient is Diabetic or Non-Diabetic based on medical parameters provided in the dataset.

This project uses a real-world healthcare dataset obtained from Kaggle and demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

2. Problem Statement

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection of diabetes can help in effective treatment and lifestyle management. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict:

* Diabetic – Patient has diabetes
* Non-Diabetic – Patient does not have diabetes

based on medical diagnostic parameters.

5. Methodology

The project follows these steps:

 5.1 Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using Pandas.
* Basic data analysis is performed to understand structure and missing values.

 5.2 Data Preprocessing

* Features and target labels are separated.
* Missing or invalid values are handled.
* Feature scaling is applied to improve SVM performance.
* Data is split into **training** and **testing** datasets.

 5.3 Model Selection

* Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected because:

  * It performs well on high-dimensional data
  * It is effective for binary classification problems
  * It provides good generalization capability

 5.4 Model Training

* The SVM model is trained using the training dataset.
* The model learns the decision boundary that separates diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

 5.5 Model Testing

* The trained model is evaluated on unseen test data.
* Predictions are generated to assess performance.

6. Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score – Measures overall correctness of predictions

Evaluation Metrics:

* Training Accuracy
* Testing Accuracy

Balanced accuracy values indicate a reliable and well-generalized model.
