Stone vs Mine – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Stone vs Mine
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression

The Stone vs Mine project is a supervised machine learning classification task. The objective of this project is to predict whether a given object detected by sonar signals is a Mine or a Rock. This prediction is based on numerical features extracted from sonar signal readings.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.

2. Problem Statement

Sonar systems are commonly used to detect underwater objects. However, distinguishing between mines and rocks using sonar data is challenging. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify an object as:

Mine (M) – Dangerous underwater explosive object
Rock (R) – Harmless natural object

3. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of multiple numerical features representing sonar signal strength values.
Each row corresponds to a single object.
The target variable contains two classes:

   `M` → Mine
   `R` → Rock

Key Characteristics:

* Numerical feature set
* Binary classification problem
* Labeled dataset suitable for supervised learning

4. Tools and Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:

  * NumPy – Numerical computations
  * Pandas – Data handling and analysis
  * Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) – Data visualization

5. Methodology

The project follows these main steps:

  5.1 Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
* Initial exploration is performed to understand data shape, types, and class distribution.

  5.2 Data Preprocessing

* Features and target labels are separated.
* Target labels are encoded into numerical format.
* Data is split into **training** and **testing** sets using `train_test_split`.

  5.3 Model Selection

  Logistic Regression is chosen due to:

  * Its effectiveness in binary classification problems
  * Simplicity and interpretability
  * Good performance on linearly separable data

  5.4 Model Training

* The logistic regression model is trained using the training dataset.
* The model learns the relationship between sonar features and object type.
  
  5.5 Model Testing

* The trained model is evaluated on unseen test data.
* Predictions are generated for the test dataset.

---

6. Model Evaluation

The model performance is measured using:

* **Accuracy Score** – Percentage of correct predictions

 Evaluation Results:

* Training Accuracy: Evaluates how well the model fits training data
* Testing Accuracy: Evaluates model generalization on new data

A higher and balanced accuracy on both training and testing data indicates a well-performing model.

  7. Results and Observations

* The logistic regression model successfully classifies sonar signals into Mine or Rock categories.
* The model demonstrates good generalization with acceptable accuracy.
* Proper data splitting helps avoid overfitting.

  8. Conclusion

The *Stone vs Mine* project successfully implements a machine learning classification system using logistic regression. The model is capable of predicting whether an underwater object is a mine or a rock based on sonar data. This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation in data science workflows.
