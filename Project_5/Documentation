Loan Prediction – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Loan Prediction (Accept / Reject)  
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning  
Algorithm Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The Loan Prediction project is a supervised machine learning classification task. The objective of this project is to predict whether a loan application should be Accepted or Rejected based on applicant and financial information.

This project focuses on data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and improving model performance using appropriate SVM parameters.

2. Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to evaluate loan applications efficiently and accurately to reduce risk. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and prone to errors. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classify loan applications as:

* Accepted – Loan can be approved
* Rejected – Loan should be denied

based on historical loan data.

3. Dataset Description

* The dataset contains applicant demographic and financial details.
* Each row represents a single loan application.
* The dataset includes both categorical and numerical features.

Common Features (Table Headers):

* Gender
* Marital Status
* Education
* Applicant Income
* Coapplicant Income
* Loan Amount
* Loan Term
* Credit History
* Property Area

Target Variable:

* `0` → Loan Rejected
* `1` → Loan Accepted

4. Tools and Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:

  * NumPy – Numerical computations
  * Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
  * Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

5. Methodology

 5.1 Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
* Initial exploration is performed to understand data structure and missing values.

 5.2 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Missing values are handled appropriately.
* Categorical variables are relabeled into numerical form:

  * Encoded as `0`, `1`, or `2` based on category values
* Features and target variable are separated.
* The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

 5.3 Problem Faced During Modeling

* Initially, the SVM model predicted only one class (1) for all input values.
* This issue occurred due to:

  * Class imbalance in the dataset
  * Default SVM kernel and parameters not handling imbalance effectively

 5.4 Solution Implemented

To resolve the issue, the following changes were applied:

* Set kernel = 'linear' to improve decision boundary learning
* Used class_weight = 'balanced' to handle class imbalance by assigning equal importance to both classes

These changes significantly improved model performance and prediction balance.

 5.5 Model Selection

* Support Vector Machine (SVM) is chosen because:

  * It works well for binary classification problems
  * It is effective in high-dimensional spaces
  * It provides robust decision boundaries

 5.6 Model Training

* The SVM model is trained using the cleaned and preprocessed training dataset.
* The model learns to distinguish between accepted and rejected loan applications.

 5.7 Model Testing

* The trained model is evaluated on unseen test data.
* Predictions are generated for performance analysis.

6. Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score – Overall prediction correctness
* Confusion Matrix – Distribution of predicted vs actual values
* Classification Report – Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Balanced metrics indicate a reliable and fair classification model.

---

7. Results and Observations

* The updated SVM model predicts both classes correctly.
* Using `class_weight='balanced'` prevents biased predictions.
* Linear kernel improves interpretability and performance.

---

8. Conclusion

The Loan Prediction project successfully implements an SVM-based classification model to determine loan approval status. This project highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing and handling class imbalance in real-world machine learning applications.

9. Future Enhancements

* Apply feature scaling for improved SVM performance
* Try different kernels (RBF, Polynomial)
* Use SMOTE for class imbalance handling
* Compare performance with Logistic Regression or Random Forest
