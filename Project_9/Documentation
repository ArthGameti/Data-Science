Customer Segmentation using K-Means – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name: Customer Segmentation using K-Means  
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning  
Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

The Customer Segmentation project focuses on grouping customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes. Unlike supervised learning, this project uses unsupervised learning to discover hidden patterns in customer data.

Customer segmentation helps businesses understand different customer groups and design targeted marketing strategies.

2. Problem Statement

Businesses often treat all customers the same, which leads to inefficient marketing and lower customer satisfaction. The goal of this project is to segment customers into meaningful groups based on similarities in their data.

These segments can help businesses:

* Improve marketing campaigns
* Personalize offers
* Increase customer retention
* Understand customer behavior

---

3. Dataset Description

* The dataset contains customer-related information such as spending behavior and income.
* Each row represents one customer.
* No target variable is present, as this is an unsupervised learning problem.

### Common Features:

* Customer ID
* sex
* Age
* Annual Income
* Spending Score

4. Tools and Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:

  * NumPy – Numerical computations
  * Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
  * Scikit-learn – Clustering and evaluation

---

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed exploratory analysis to understand customer distribution:

* Analyzed income and spending patterns
* Visualized customer distribution using scatter plots
* Identified trends and potential clusters

EDA played a key role in selecting appropriate features for clustering.

6. Methodology

 6.1 Data Preprocessing

* Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Customer ID)
* Handled missing values if present
* Selected relevant numerical features
* Applied feature scaling to improve clustering performance

 6.2 Choosing Optimal Number of Clusters

* Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K)
* Plotted Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) vs K

 6.3 Model Building

* Applied K-Means clustering with optimal K
* Assigned each customer to a cluster

 6.4 Visualization of Clusters

* Visualized customer segments using scatter plots
* Different colors represent different customer groups

---

7. Results and Observations

* Customers were successfully grouped into distinct clusters
* Each cluster represented a unique customer segment
* Clear separation was observed between high-spending and low-spending customers

---

8. Conclusion

The *Customer Segmentation using K-Means* project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be used to uncover hidden patterns in data. The clustering results can help businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize customer engagement strategies.

9. Future Enhancements

* Try other clustering algorithms like Hierarchical or DBSCAN
* Include more customer attributes
* Deploy clustering results into a business dashboard
* Perform cluster profiling for better interpretation
