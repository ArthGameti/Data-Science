Car Price Predictor – Data Science Project Documentation

1. Project Overview

Project Name Car Price Predictor  
Domain: Data Science / Machine Learning  
Algorithms Used: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression

The Car Price Predictor project is a supervised machine learning regression task. The objective of this project is to predict the price of a car based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, and usage-related parameters.

In this project, both Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models were trained and evaluated. After comparison, Lasso Regression was found to perform better and provide more accurate predictions.

2. Problem Statement

Estimating the resale price of a car is difficult due to multiple influencing factors. Manual estimation often leads to incorrect pricing. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict car prices based on historical data.

This helps:

* Buyers avoid overpaying
* Sellers set fair prices
* Businesses automate vehicle valuation

---

3. Dataset Description

* The dataset contains information about used cars.
* Each row represents one car record.
* The dataset used is relatively small making model selection and regularization important.

Common Features (Table Headers):

* Car Name / Brand
* Year
* Selling Price
* Present Price
* Kilometers Driven
* Fuel Type
* Seller Type
* Transmission Type
* Number of Owners

Target Variable:

* Selling Price – Predicted car price

4. Tools and Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:

  * NumPy – Numerical computations
  * Pandas – Data handling and analysis
  * Scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation
  * Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) – Visualization
  * Metrics - R Squre - Accuracy

5. Methodology

 5.1 Data Loading

* The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
* Initial exploration is performed to understand data size and feature types.

 5.2 Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values (if any)
* Encoded categorical variables into numerical format
* Separated independent features and target variable
* Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets

 5.3 Model Training

Two regression models were trained:

 Linear Regression

* Used as a baseline regression model
* Performs well on linear relationships but may overfit on small datasets

 Lasso Regression

* Adds L1 regularization to linear regression
* Helps reduce overfitting
* Performs feature selection by shrinking less important coefficients to zero

---

6. Model Comparison & Selection

* Both models were evaluated using regression metrics
* Lasso Regression showed better performance compared to Linear Regression
* Lasso provided more stable and accurate predictions on the small dataset

This demonstrates the importance of regularization when working with limited data.

---

7. Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using:

* R² Score

Lasso Regression achieved superior evaluation scores compared to Linear Regression.

---

8. Results and Observations

* Lasso Regression outperformed Linear Regression
* Regularization helped prevent overfitting
* Model performed well despite limited dataset size
* No separate single-instance prediction system was implemented in this project

---

9. Conclusion

The Car Price Predictor project successfully compares Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models for car price prediction. The results highlight that Lasso Regression is more effective** for small datasets due to its regularization capability.

---

10. Future Enhancements

* Build a single-instance prediction system
* Use Ridge Regression and ElasticNet for comparison
* Increase dataset size for improved generalization
* Deploy the model as a web application
